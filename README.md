# 3D Occupancy Perception in Autonomous Driving

This repository is associated with the review paper titled "**3D Occupancy Perception for Autonomous Driving**," which provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in 3D dense perception. The review covers various methodologies, including **LiDAR-Centric Occupancy Perception**, **Vision-Centric Occupancy Perception**, and **Multi-Modal Occupancy Perception**.

We discuss the state-of-the-art information fusion techniques and provide insights into the future directions of 3D perception in autonomous driving. This repository will be actively maintained with updates and additional resources. We believe this will be the most comprehensive survey to date on 3D Occupancy Perception.
